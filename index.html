            <p>I'm an '80s girl! I was born and raised in the mountains of Italy, in a little village near the 
            French border. I moved to the U.S. about 12 years ago. I used to live in Chicago, 
            and for a little bit I lived in L.A. and on the East Coast. Last year, my partner and I moved to St Louis, MO 
            where we bought our first house. We have a dog named Barley, and two cats named Hops and Branzino.
            We all love it here! <br>
            I've worked in the restaurant industry for a long time and prior to that I was a project 
            manager in the foodservice and enviromental sustainability sectors. The Covid-19 pandemic changed my industry 
            a lot - and for the worse, unfortunately - so I decided to launch my new career in tech and 
            dove into the Flatiron Software Engineering program.
