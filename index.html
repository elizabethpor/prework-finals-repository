        <h2>profile</h2>
        <p>I'm an '80s girl, born and raised in the mountains of Italy, in a little village near the 
            French border. I moved to the U.S. about 12 years ago and I've lived mostly in Chicago, 
            but also in L.A. and the East Coast. Last year, my partner and I moved to St Louis, MO 
            where we bought our first house. I love it here! I've worked in the foodservice industry
            for a long time and prior to that I was a project manager in the enviromental sustainability
            sector. The Covid-19 pandemic changed my industry a lot - and for the worse, unfortunately - 
            so I decided to launch my new career in tech and dove into the Flatiron Software Engineering program.
